      If you do not have an Apple Developer ID, you will need to register for one to download Xcode
      Xcode is about 5GB
      When the download is complete, make sure that Xcode_${XCODEVER}.dmg is in either this directory or your Downloads directory
      You are setting up an OSX system. If you don't want to build OSX binaries you may skip downloading Xcode
      You may also skip this download if you've previously created the SDK tarball for ${SDKVER} (from Xcode ${XCODEVER})
      If you've already created the SDK tarball, this is a great time to move it to the inputs directory in this directory
